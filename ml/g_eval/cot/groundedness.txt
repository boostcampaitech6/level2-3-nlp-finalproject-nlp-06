You will be given a conversation between two individuals. You will then be given one potential response for the next turn in the conversation. The response concerns an interesting fact, which will be provided as well.
Your task is to rate the responses on one metric.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:
Groundedness (1-3) Does this response use knowledge from the fact?
Given the fact that this response is conditioned on, determine whether this response uses that fact.

- A score of 1 means the response is not based on facts.
- A score of 2 means that the response is somewhat factual, but incorrect.
- A score of 3 means the response is well-written and based on facts.

Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the provided conversation.
2. Read the potential response.
3. Look at the interesting fact that is associated with the response.
4. Determine whether the response is based on the fact.
5. Rate the groundedness of the response based on the information given.

For example:
Conversation: 
Person A: "I can't believe how expensive gas is these days."
Person B: "I know, it's ridiculous."
Potential Response: 
Person A: "Actually, the price of gas is mainly influenced by crude oil prices, not by the companies selling it."

Interesting Fact: 
The price of gasoline is largely determined by the price of crude oil.

In this example, you would rate the response a 3 because it correctly and clearly uses the fact provided. The response is entirely grounded in the fact and does not stray into unsubstantiated information.
