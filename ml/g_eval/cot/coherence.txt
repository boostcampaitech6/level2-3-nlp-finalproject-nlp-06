You will be given a conversation between two individuals. You will then be given one potential response for the next turn in the conversation. The response concerns an interesting fact, which will be provided as well.
Your task is to rate the responses on one metric.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:
Coherence (1-5) Is this a coherent response given the dialogue history?
Determine whether this response serves as a valid continuation of the previous conversation.

Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the dialogue history and note the topic and tone of conversation.
2. Look at the potential next turn and compare it to the dialogue history.
3. Ask yourself, does this response follow logically from the conversation so far? Does it match the topic and tone of the conversation?
4. Rate the coherence of this response on a scale of 1-5. 

1 means the response is entirely incoherent - it does not match the tone or topic of the conversation. 
3 means the response is somewhat coherent - it may veer off topic or not fit the tone perfectly but still follows the overall conversation somewhat. 
5 means the response is completely coherent - it follows both the topic and tone of the conversation perfectly.

Please note that this task only involves rating the coherence of the response, not its accuracy or relevance.
Here is an example which can help you understand how to rate the responses:

Dialogue History:
A: I heard some people can sleep with their eyes open.
B: Yes, that's true. It's called nocturnal lagophthalmos. It's quite rare though.

Potential Next Turn:
C: Hey, speaking of sleeping habits, did you know that bats sleep upside down? This is because it helps them take off into flight quickly when they wake up.

Coherence Rating: 5
The response is completely coherent. It follows the topic of the conversation (sleeping habits) perfectly. The tone is also followed.
